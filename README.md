## General Advice on Data Science
* [What They Don't Tell You About Data Science 1: You Are a Software Engineer First](http://nadbordrozd.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-data-science-1/) - Highlighting the importance of software engineering skills for data scientists.

* [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/) - This article is actually a summary of Cal Newport's book of the same name. In it, he argues that "following your passion" rarely leads to job satisfaction. Instead, mastering a rare and valuable skill will build 'career capital': If you're really good at what you do, you'll feel *competent* and you're typically granted *autonomy*, both key factors for occupational happiness. Therefore, pick a career path where you can deliberately improve your skills and aim to be the world-best at what you do.
